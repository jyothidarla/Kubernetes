ReplicaSet
===================
This is also similar to ReplicationController but it is more
advanced and it can also handle load balancing and scalling
It has an additional field in spec section called as "selector"
This selector uses a child element "matchLabels" where the
it will search for Pod based on a specific label name and try to add
them to the cluster

Create a replicaset file to start 4 tomcat replicas  and then perform scalling
vim replica-set.yml

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: ReplicaSet
metadata:
 name: tomcat-rs
 labels:
  type: webserver
  author: ajay
spec:
 replicas: 4
 selector:
  matchLabels:
   type: webserver
   
 template:
  metadata:
   name: tomcat-pod
   labels:
    type: webserver
  spec:
   containers:
    - name: mywebserver
      image: tomee
      ports:
       - containerPort: 8080
         hostPort: 9090

To create the pods from the above file
kubectl create -f replica-set.yml

Scalling can be done in 2 ways
a) Update the file and later scale it

b) Scale from the coomand prompt withbout updating the defintion file

a) Update the file and later scale it
  Open the replicas-set.yml file and increase the replicas count from 4 to 6
  kubectl replace -f replicas-set.yml
  Check if 6 pods of tomcat are running
  kubectl get pods

b) Scale from the coomand prompt withbout updating the defintion file
   kubectl scale --replicas=2 -f replica-set.yml
